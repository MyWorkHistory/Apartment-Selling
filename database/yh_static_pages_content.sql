Nasheed has urged the country to stick to what he describes as the more \"tolerant\" strain of Islam that it has practiced for hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nOpposition groups staged a demonstration on December 23 in which they advocated, among other things, for a crackdown on massage parlors in the capital, Male, and other more densely populated areas.\r\n\r\nRather than ignore the demands, the government raised the stakes last week by issuing an order to close all massage parlors and spas across the country\'s nearly 1,200 coral islands.', '', 'DB', 'DB'),

See our guide to Buying Property in Bulgaria for more information.<br />&bull;Viewing<br />&nbsp; It is usually possible to view the property prior to the auction. However, this is not usually the case with properties that have tenants. Yantra Homes will advise you of the viewing situation. When you are considering buying a Bulgarian property at auction you need to find out everything possible about the property of your choice. If your bid is successful in the auction room, the property is yours, a contract is concluded on the sale of the property and it will be too late to cancel the sale if you come across a problem.<br />&bull;Auction Dates<br />&nbsp; Sometimes the date of the auction has not been set. There is a procedure that must be followed to set the date of the auction, this process can take one or two months. Yantra Homes can explain this in detail and assist with the process as and when it is required.<br />&nbsp; Once the date of the auction is set, it is necessary to register as a bidder, this must be done at least 24 hours before the actual auction date. The procedure requires that you to prove your identity with an ID card or passport, and quite a few documents must be filled out, together with the payment of a non-returnable administration fee. (50 - 300 BGN)<br />&bull;Starting Price and bidding steps<br />&nbsp; There will be a starting price for the property, this is published in advance, and often there are steps that must be adhered to for subsequent bids. Once you are registered you can make your initial bid, not less than the starting price. This will remain in a sealed envelope until the start of the auction<br />&bull;Auction day finance and bidding<br />&nbsp; You must have all your finances in order, before biding, a deposit is required, the amount varies depending upon the auction rules, but is between 10 - 30% of the starting price. This deposit must be made into the auctioneers bank account and will be refunded only if your bid is unsuccessful.<br />&nbsp; Now begins the exciting part of the process, you must arrive at the auction before the published time and again prove your identity. At the start of the proceedings all sealed bids will be opened. If you are lucky yours will be the only one, in which case the final price will be your starting bid. If there is more than one bidder, the auctioneer will ask for a higher bid than the starting price. If bidding steps were published, you must follow them. If not a hundred Bulgarian Leva will be considered valid.<br />As is customary, the highest bid will secure the property. In Veliko Tarnovo property auctions, it is rare for a property to have a reserve price above the starting bid<br />&bull;Final Payment<br />&nbsp; If your bid is successful - the property is now yours. If not you may either obtain a refund of your deposit or leave it in place for up to one month, in the event that the first bidder defaults, your bid will then be accepted as the next in line.<br />&nbsp; There is a specified period within which successful bidders must pay the balance. This varies according to the auction rules, but is usually 20 working days. Some auctioneers do have schemes whereby you must pay any VAT immediately, followed by 12 monthly instalments to pay the balance. Yantra Homes will advise you in advance of the payment terms/rules.<br />&nbsp;<br />Yantra Homes Services for buying Bulgarian property at Auction<br />&nbsp; &bull;Yantra Homes work on a no win no fee basis. We do not charge any upfront fees.

Never be tempted to buy, knowing that you have the deposit to hand and thinking you can easily raise the balance later. As in all property purchases, there are penalties if you cannot come up with the balance on completion, usually 20 working days from the date of the auction, but in some instances this can be less.</p>', 'en/bulgarianpropertyauctions.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),

Learn the essentials before you make an investment by reading through this essential guide.', 'Things to Know Before Buying Property in Bulgaria', '<p>If you\'re looking to invest in real estate, Bulgarian property is a great option to consider. Bulgaria offers many opportunities for foreign investors, with a stable economy and low property taxes. In this article, we\'ll discuss everything you need to know about buying Bulgarian property for sale.</p>\r\n', 'www.yantrahomes.co.uk/en/buying-property-bulgaria', '<p>\r\n	Buying property in Veliko Tarnovo - Bulgarian real estate specialists with the best properties for sale in Bulgaria including houses, apartments, development land and commercial property.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Buying property in Bulgaria - A Guide for foreign Buyers<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Introduction<br />\r\n	We offer this advice as a simple guide to buying property in Bulgaria. Please bear in mind that all clients and their situations are different and that the circumstances surrounding any sale or purchase can lead to modifications in this advice.<br />\r\n	You should employ the services of a lawyer (preferably one who can communicate with you in a language you understand).&nbsp;&nbsp; We ALWAYS recommend the use of an independent lawyer for property transactions.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Land Ownership in Bulgaria<br />\r\n	In accordance with the Bulgarian Act on Foreign Investment, there are currently restrictions on foreigners who wish to buy property in Bulgaria that refer specifically to buying Bulgarian land, however this is due to change in 2014 under the Treaty of Accession by which Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. Then citizens of other EU countries will be permitted to own certain types of land, however restrictions will still apply to non-EU citizens.<br />\r\n	All foreigners wanting to own Bulgarian land (i.e. Bulgarian houses with a garden or a plot of land in Bulgaria) must set up and register a Bulgarian Limited Company.&nbsp; The procedure involved is fairly straightforward, currently taking around 3-5 working days if you are around to sign the documents or if not you can give the power of attorney or your Solicitor, Agent&nbsp; or another trusted third party, who can complete the process on your behalf.<br />\r\n	There are usually no such restrictions on foreigners who purchase apartments so long as there is no Bulgarian land involved, if there is, then the same restrictions apply and they also will have to set up a Bulgarian Limited Company.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	The Buying Process<br />\r\n	There is a choice of two types of company you may register, either a Limited Liability Company or a Sole Proprietor Limited Company.<br />\r\n	&bull;&nbsp; A Limited Liability Company is formed by 2 or more shareholders. Shares in the company are distributed between these shareholders, and although normally divided equally, say between husband and wife, this decision is entirely up to you.<br />\r\n	&bull; A Sole Proprietor Limited Company is formed when an individual solely owns the whole assets of the company. In this case there are no other shareholders or partners; however it is possible to add shareholders and to change the registered address at a later date. ( In choosing this option, please be aware that the Inheritance Laws in Bulgaria differ from those of, say USA and UK and you should seek legal advice regarding a writing a will in your own country).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n	To form the company the following documents are required, and will be arranged by your Solicitor:<br />\r\n	&bull; An article of association /Constitutive deed;<br />\r\n	&bull; Minutes of the General meeting of the company for setting up a company;<br />\r\n	&bull; Notarised consent and signature specimen;<br />\r\n	&bull; Declarations pursuant to Art. 142 of the Commercial Act;<br />\r\n	&bull; Declarations pursuant to article 13, Para 4 of the Commercial Register Law;<br />\r\n	&bull; Minutes of the General meeting of the company containing a resolution to purchase real estate in the Republic of Bulgaria and appointing an attorney to take the appropriate actions regarding the purchase.<br />\r\n	When setting up a company in Bulgaria you will need to open a personal account at a local bank. You can open it in Euros or in Bulgarian Lev (LV); this bank account will be used for money transfers relating to property purchases. It does not need to be a business bank account even though you are buying the property through a company.&nbsp; The minimum deposit required to open this account is 2 Lev (LV).&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Once the company is registered, you can withdraw the balance and close the account if you wish, however, we would advise clients that they might like to leave the account open so it can be used for direct debits, internet banking, etc in the future.<br />\r\n	Now the company is setup, you are ready to start the process of buying property in Bulgaria and as this is a one-time procedure, you may now use your Bulgarian Limited Company to buy as many properties as you desire anywhere in Bulgaria.<br />\r\n	As a registered company, you are legally obliged to file an annual return, but if the company is not actively trading (i.e. for Bulgarian property ownership only), this is reasonably cheap and easy to do.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Contracts<br />\r\n	When you have found a property you want to buy and your offer has been accepted a preliminary contract that protects the interests of both buyer and seller, will be drawn up by your Bulgarian Real estate Agent&nbsp; who will make the necessary checks of the title deeds to ensure that the property has a valid freehold title.&nbsp; You will then have to pay a 10% deposit (non-refundable) to the Seller.&nbsp; You should employ the services of a lawyer (preferably one who speaks a language you understand) to handle the sale on your behalf.<br />\r\n	When finalising the purchase of a property, the following documents must be presented by the Seller:<br />\r\n	&bull; Original title deed<br />\r\n	&bull; Updated plan of the property<br />\r\n	&bull; A document issued from the Property Register with the Registry Agency to show the actual status of the property to ensure there are no burdens, mortgages, foreclosures, pending court disputes, alienation deals, rights in favour of third parties etc.<br />\r\n	The above paperwork is required by the public notary to complete the purchase. It usually takes around four weeks for the sale to go through at which time you will be expected to pay the remaining 90%, notary fees and taxes before obtaining the title deeds for the property.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Bulgarian Property Taxes<br />\r\n	Historically Bulgaria property sales included the common practice of under-declaring the actual value of a property on the title deed in order for both the seller and the buyer to save on property taxes.&nbsp; This lower value cannot be below the &lsquo;tax valuation &rsquo;assessed by the tax authority but is usually considerably lower than the sale/purchase price.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Although this can appear beneficial to both parties at the time of purchase, it can actually work against the buyer at the point of any future sale of the property because the difference between the theoretical purchase price and sale price stated on the title deeds would be greater than the difference between the actual purchase price and the sale price. This would give rise to a greater perceived profit and hence greater capital gains tax liability.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	There are taxes to be paid on all property transactions resulting in a profit made by a company. Private individuals may sell one property every three years, without the need to declare the profit for tax.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	As it is still very much in the seller&rsquo;s interest to under-declare the value, it is up to the buyer to specifically request the full valuation to be entered on the title deeds. This will usually cost a little extra in up-front taxes, but it should be more than compensated for at the time of sale.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Buying property in Bulgaria - Additional Costs/Fees to be Paid<br />\r\n	When buying property in Veliko Tarnovo with Yantra Homes, in addition to the price of the property the following costs/fees should be taken into consideration:<br />\r\n	&bull; The usual fee charged for setting up a Limited Company is Euro 350.00 including disbursals;<br />\r\n	&bull; Our agency fee is 3% of the purchase price, subject to a minimum of Euro 750 (Please note: In Bulgaria it is standard practice for the buyer to pay agency fees);<br />\r\n	&bull; Notary, stamp, court fees and property tax (legal fees) are approx 4 &ndash; 5% of the declared deed value (see Property Tax section above).&nbsp; (This fee is paid directly to the Notary Public);<br />\r\n	&bull; Solicitor fees the same as the Notary fees at&nbsp; 4 &ndash; 5% of the declared deed value; (Paid directly to the solicitor);<br />\r\n	&bull; Transfer of property deeds are usually Euro 200;<br />\r\n	&bull; Company accounting (annual tax return) approximately Euro 200;<br />\r\n	&bull; Registering utility contracts (water, electricity, etc) usually charged at Euro 25 per contract;<br />\r\n	&bull; Our charges for any after sales services @ the rate of Leva (LV) 20 per hour.</p>\r\n', 'en/buyingpropertybulgaria.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),

- How to get the best price for your property in Bulgaria - Advice from Bulgarian Real Estate Agents<br />&nbsp;<br />Guide to selling your property in Bulgaria<br />&nbsp;<br />Time To Sell up?<br />&nbsp;<br />If the time has come for you to put up your Bulgarian property for sale, what do you do to ensure you get top dollar for it at a time when Bulgarian house prices are falling and there are fewer buyers in the market and there is plenty of Bulgarian real estate for sale?? <br />&nbsp;<br />Firstly you must decide what you truly believe is\'s worth in today&rsquo;s marketplace.&nbsp; Be realistic and don\'t make the mistake of over&ndash;valuing. <br />&nbsp;<br />Certainly you will have seen many properties in Bulgarian Estate Agents&rsquo; displays that seem to have been there forever ndash; what is your perception of why they are still there?&nbsp; Probably that there is something wrong with them, when it might just be the case that they were overpriced to begin with and have generated no interest in potential buyers until there reaches a point of having to be taken off the market and then reintroduced later at a lower price.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are unsure as to the value of your property, ask Veliko Tarnovo Estate Agents, Yantra Homes who can give you a fair estimate based on the size, condition and location of your property.<br />&nbsp;<br />Next, your Agent will want to take some photographs of your property for that all important advertising campaign.&nbsp; It is at this point the selling of your property begins.&nbsp; Just remember, those pictures he&rsquo;s snapping away at will appear in the Agency window, on the website, in magazines etc.,&nbsp; so presenting your property at its best can help you get that asking price.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are a few simple steps you can take to ensure your property is seen at its best, both in photos and during viewings:<br />&nbsp;<br />Clear up<br />Potential buyers want to see what they are actually getting for their money and not your personal belongings, so put them out of sight before photographs are taken and viewers come to see your property.<br />If you have a property, perhaps in one of the Bulgarian villages, that has been vacant for a long time, make sure you clean out any old furniture and personal effects left behind by the previous occupiers and at least strim a path through the undergrowth for viewers to walk around the property.<br />&nbsp;<br />Clean up<br />An hour or two vacuuming and dusting will make all the difference to occupied properties.&nbsp; You may think viewers should accept that you are living there and see through the detritus of everyday life, but unfortunately they don&rsquo;t, so as a minimum, a quick run round before they arrive can set the right impression.&nbsp; Rentals will need cleaning after previous tenants have left and then just an occasional airing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mend<br />Make any minor repairs before any viewings take place, for example: leaks, damp patches, missing roof tiles etc. Basically, repair anything that might send the wrong signals to viewers and that they could subsequently use as a negative when considering your property especially when it would only cost a few leva to fix. <br />&nbsp;<br />Furnished or Unfurnished?<br />Are you selling all or some of your furniture with your home in Bulgaria?&nbsp; If you are and it is included in the price of the property, you should ensure it is clean and in good condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no point in including a broken down fridge and a rickety sofa in your price as the viewer will definitely not want them, and will drive your price down, and rightly so.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Pets<br />If you have a dog(s) or cat for that matter, try to keep them outside, kenneled or chained whilst viewings are taking place, or better still, if they don&rsquo;t like strangers, get a friend to look after them for a while &ndash; there is not much that puts off potential buyers more than being chased down the road by an angry dog! <br />You may not think your pet has a smell, but be assured it does.&nbsp; If you allow pets to come inside, your house will have that musty &lsquo;doggy&rsquo; odour, and as much as you love your pet, others don&rsquo;t, so get some air freshener, leave the windows open and for god&rsquo;s sake get rid of that cat litter tray!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dirty pet bowls lying around are also a no-no.<br />&nbsp;<br />Smoking<br />Finally, yes, everyone in Bulgaria seems to smoke, but if you have ever been in the &lsquo;Smoking Area&rsquo; at Sofia Airport, then you know how bad stale smoke smells.&nbsp; Once you have cleaned and aired your property, don&rsquo;t smoke inside the house, it will ruin all the hard work you have put in with one cough!<br />&nbsp;<br />Conclusion:<br />Remember, particularly at a time when buyers can be few and far between, and with so many properties on the market,&nbsp; a little extra effort on your part before a viewing could make all the difference between a sale and a &lsquo;no thank-you&rsquo;.<br />&nbsp;<br />Good luck with your sale!</p>', 'en/sellingpropertybulgaria.tpl', 'template', 'DB');

Такива имоти за продажба могат да бъдат намерени при:<br />Банкови институции &ndash; техните имоти за продажба, обикновено са от ипотечни задължения, които лицето не е успяло да погаси. Друг вариант е за недвижим имот, чийто собственик предпочита да го продаде на цена, покриваща ипотеката и е готов да си сътрудничи с банката.<br />Частните съдия изпълнители или хората с дълго портфолио на имоти в България, за продажба чрез търг. При тях апартаменти или къщи в селата има доста. Те могат да обявят имоти за продажба, които са били съдебен спор между банка и частно лице или фирма; между частни лица; между фирми или с две думи доста недвижими имоти в България, без значение чия собственост са били. <br />Преди да се стигне до покупко-продажба на селска къща или апартамент и преди обявяването на имоти за продажба чрез търг, съществува процедура.

Тази дата се обявява от Частен съдия изпълнител, банката или лицензираното за това лице.<br />Обикновено, срокът се обявява около месец преди датата за продажба чрез търг. Това позволява на заинтересованите лица да се снабдят с нужния пакета документи за участие в търга. Не малък фактор е и изискуемият депозит за участие. За покупко-продажба на имот за продажба чрез търг, са нужни пари в брой. За съжаление банките тепърва започват да финансират имоти в България, обявени за продажба чрез търг. Но и тук, както при стандартната ипотека на селски къщи или апартаменти, за предпочитане и с възможност за получаване на ипотека (или по-нормален процент) са апартаменти. Разбира се с по-голям шанс са апартаментите ново строителство. <br />Като изключим банковите процедури, тези за имоти за продажба чрез търг също имат своите особености и ако човек не е запознат, може да направи минимална грешка, която да коства участието му в търга.

Има установени определения и ние, като всяка агенция за недвижими имоти, също ги използваме.<br />Определението за жилище е кратко и ясно &ndash; това е място, пригодено за постоянно живеене &ndash; апартамент, къща, фургон, палатка или барака. Разбира се, когато отидете в агенция за недвижими имоти и обясните, че сте се насочили към закупуването на Български имоти, малко колеги биха решили, че търсите палатка, изхождайки от определението за жилище, освен, ако разбира се, не сте казали точно това.<br />Ще споменем накратко и други, считани за по-ясни и познати определения: градски имот е този, който е в границите на селище, определено според стандартите и нормите като град; къщи или парцел в околните села също нямат нужда от много обяснения &ndash; разбира се, те са онези, попадащи в границите на селата. <br />Не само в сектора на недвижими имоти е разпространен договорът за покупко-продажба, но тук се насочваме към отношението му именно към сектора на недвижими имоти, който очевидно Ви вълнува в момента. Продажбата е двустранен акт, при който продавачът се задължава да прехвърли на купувача собствеността върху имота, а купувачът се задължава да заплати конкретна цена, за да получи този имот &ndash; на кратко, това е договорът за покупко-продажба.<br />Важен документ, при сключване на сделка в сектора на недвижими имоти, било то за градски имот, къщи или парцел в околните села, е скицата. На нея са отразени границите на имота, заедно с евентуални петна на сгради &ndash; селскостопански и жилищни. Данъчната оценка на имота също е неизменна част от процеса по приключване на сделката, тя се изисква от Нотариуса, за да се увери той, че продажната цена на имота не е по-ниска от преценената от местните институции такава. <br />Често ще срещате съкращението РЗП, което означава разгъната застроена площ и се получава от сбора на застроените площи на всички етажи, заедно с терасите, а и под покривното пространство, когато то спада към определението за жилище.</p>', 'bg/imotiterminologia.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),

But,with a bit of careful planning and preparation it is possible to reduce the strain and get your new life in Bulgaria off to a good start!<br />&nbsp;<br />Let&rsquo;s Get Going...<br />Getting your household effects to your new property in Bulgaria can be expensive, depending on how you mean to transport them and what you choose to bring with you. So decide what you absolutely must keep and what you really can give to charity, sell at a car boot sale, sell on eBay or throw in the bin because it could be cheaper to buy new items once you have arrived and set up you house in Bulgaria and will save a lot on transportation costs.<br />&nbsp;<br />Plan Ahead<br />Shipping by road takes approximately three to four days and by sea container a lot longer, so plan ahead regarding hotel reservations or alternative accommodation such as rental property, until your possessions arrive and you have all your services connected.<br />&nbsp;<br />Removals Companies<br />Depending on your purse strings, and if appropriate, get quotes from at least three reputable removals companies who will also &lsquo;export pack&rsquo; your belongings or who can recommend a professional packing company to do this for you. Of course, it is extra expense but well worth it as correct packing prevents undue damage to your precious items and they stand a better chance of arriving in one piece! If you decide on taking everything bar the kitchen sink you could have a self-fill container, a trailer or a designated vehicle with a crew to help you unload once you have reached your new home in Bulgaria. Many people forget that unloading can be a gruelling task especially in the Bulgarian summer months where temperatures are around 30?C or in the winter where they can be as low as -15?C. So decide whether help is needed and make sure your movers are aware of this as there may be additional costs involved.<br />&nbsp;<br />Remember, if you do decide to use a professional removal company and you have any parking restrictions at your present property, you will need to contact the local authorities to arrange for a suspension of the restrictions outside your property on and around moving day as it can take more than one day to load the lorry.&nbsp; A removal lorry can be the same size as a double decker bus and needs extra space for manoeuvring into position and the rear of the vehicle should be directly outside your front door. You should provide the movers with a copy of the inventory, your mobile phone number and instructions on how to find the address of your new home in Bulgaria so that on the pre-arranged arrival date, you can meet them at your property.<br />&nbsp;<br />Self Packing &amp; Driving<br />You can of course do your own packing and depending on the size of your move you could opt for a part load, (sharing a vehicle with other small consignments), which is the most economical way of transporting your goods, or if you have managed to lose most of your chattels and are taking very little with you, you may decide to save the expense and drive yourself and your possessions across Europe, particularly if you don&rsquo;t want to part with your car.<br />If you do decide to drive over, you will also have to take an inventory of what you have with you, and carry this with you to present to customs. You will also be asked for proof of ownership of your vehicle and should therefore carry your registration documents (ensuring YOUR name is on them), and a valid driving licence. If you are driving with a trailer make sure your goods are secure and are safe during overnight stops. It is not advisable to drive during the winter months as some roads can be perilous due to snow and icy conditions.<br />&nbsp;<br />Disclaimer:<br />Yantra Homes Ltd. produced this information solely as a service to its clients and in doing so has taken all reasonable care to&nbsp; ensure the accuracy of the content.

Particularly if you are British (who would rather leave their wife behind than the dog).<br />So if you are moving to a new house in Bulgaria and want to bring your pet with you, you should start preparations well in advance (7 - 8 months) as the procedures involved must be carried out in the correct sequence and time frame in order for your pet to receive its Pet Passport in plenty of time.<br />&nbsp;<br />Pet Passport?<br />Under the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) your dog or cat can travel with you throughout EU member countries without the need for quarantine so long as it is accompanied by a Pet Passport.<br />EU legislation now allows rabbits, some birds,&nbsp; tropical fish, reptiles, guinea pigs, hamsters and mice to travel too - and they don\'t need a Pet Passport.<br />&nbsp;<br />In the UK, firstly get in touch with DEFRA (Dept of Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs) and get your trip organised. Choose whether you and/or your pet are travelling by air, sea or train. DEFRA have a full list of approved carriers as well as ports of exit and entry that you must use under the PETS Scheme.<br />&nbsp;<br />To comply with the requirements of the scheme, your pet must firstly be micro-chipped, then be vaccinated against rabies and finally have a blood test a month after vaccination to ensure it has created enough antibodies against rabies. All details including microchip information, vaccinations and blood testing must be entered correctly on the passport and then signed and stamped by an Official Veterinarian (OV).<br />&nbsp;<br />In Great Britain, a government authorised vet (OV) issues the passport. If your veterinary practice does not have a resident OV, your vet should be able to tell you where the nearest one is.<br />It is your responsibility to ensure all the information on the passport is correct before travelling and any errors or omissions may mean your pet has to be quarantined.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are British wish to bring your pet back to the UK, your cat or dog may not enter the UK before 6 months have passed from the date when the initial blood test was taken. You must have a vet treat it against ticks and tapeworm not less than 24 hours and not more than 48 hours before it is checked in with an approved transport company for its journey back.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are bringing your pet in from a non-EU country, then you will have to go to your vet and have the microchip inserted, the vaccinations and blood test done in the same way as EU members, however, you should check with your vet on any additional treatments and/or documentation you may need for entry.<br />If you wish to take your pet outside of the EU, you should seek advice on any quarantine regulations of that country at the relevant Embassy.<br />&nbsp;<br />Airlines<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you travel by plane and will be accompanying your pet, some airlines may allow you to book it in as excess baggage as opposed to cargo, this usually works out cheaper.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your pet must fly in an IATA approved crate and you should check with the airline about how to measure your pet for an IATA approved crate. Airlines should provide information guides on how to do this.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may decide to appoint a dedicated pet relocation company who will collect your pet, complete all the documentation and transport it safely for you.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid air-sickness, feed your pet at least 4 hours before flying. Give it plenty of exercise and an opportunity to go to the toilet before it is confined to its crate.<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you feel your pet will be traumatised by the journey, you should ask your vet for advice and perhaps get it some form of sedation.<br />&nbsp;<br />Ferries &amp; Car<br />&bull;&nbsp;Before starting your journey by car, either fit a secure dog guard to the luggage compartment of your car or have an appropriate sized crate for your pet (to which your pet should have been previously acclimatised). You may also consider a dog safety harness for the journey.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Make sure your pet has contact information on a tag on its collar.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Try and get to the port early so that the carrier can give you a suitable position on the car deck for your pet.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Travel overnight if possible, when the temperature is cooler and your pet can sleep.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Make sure that the ferry company officials responsible for loading know that there is a live animal in your vehicle, and follow their instructions.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Before you leave your vehicle, make sure that your pet will have enough ventilation (windows can be safely left slightly open with the use of a window guard).<br />&bull;&nbsp;Make sure your pet is comfortable with a familiar blanket or toy, and has enough water.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Never leave your pet in a vehicle in direct strong sunshine or high temperatures. The use of window shades will reduce the risk of your pet overheating.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Anyone who has travelled on ferries knows that for obvious safety reasons you are not normally able to visit the vehicle decks while the ferry is at sea. However, you should be able to arrange this if it is necessary. The ferry company will tell you about its access policy.<br />&bull;&nbsp;You shouldn&rsquo;t need to check on your pet on shorter ferry crossings (-2hrs). However, if this is essential (for example, in severe weather conditions), you can ask permission from staff at the information desk.<br />&bull;&nbsp;On longer ferry crossings (2+ hrs) you should arrange to visit your pet at suitable times to check on it and, if appropriate, to give it more water and food and an opportunity to exercise and go to the toilet. (check with the information desk).<br /><br />Eurotunnel Shuttle<br />&bull;&nbsp;When making your booking on Le Shuttle for your trip from UK to France, inform them that you will be travelling with your pet. There is no Pet Control on the UK side so all you need to do is arrive and check-in at the Terminal. If you are returning to the UK you will have to declare your pet at the Pet Control Building at the French Terminal where you will present your Pet Passport to prove it meets with UK regulations.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Your pet will then travel with you in your vehicle, but will not be permitted outside during the journey. Your pet can stretch its legs at one of the dedicated exercise areas at both the UK and French Terminals.<br />&bull;&nbsp;The journey will take approx 35 minutes and is therefore much less stressful for your pet.<br />&bull;&nbsp;The current cost for a one-way journey is currently EURO 46, however guide dogs, birds, small mammals and insects can travel free of charge.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are driving, make sure you stop every couple of hours to give your dog a toilet break, some exercise, food and water. If you need to stop overnight on your journey, make sure your pet is comfortable in the car or find a &lsquo;pet friendly&rsquo; hotel &ndash; you can find them by visiting: Petfriendlyhotels<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information and advice visit about relocating with pets: DEFRA<br />&nbsp;<br />Check out our other info pages to find out more about Bulgaria living<br />&nbsp;<br />Disclaimer:<br />Yantra Homes Ltd.produced this information solely as a service to its clients and in doing so has taken all reasonable care to&nbsp; ensure the accuracy of the content.

Достъпът до имота, не само до селски къщи или парцел, е много важен фактор.<br />Когато става въпрос за апартамент за продажба или под наем, то тогава обърнете внимание на <br />комуникациите наоколо.

Изборът на подходящ квартал или зона, е важен - ако не познавате района, питайте агента от избраната агенция за недвижими имоти.<br />Когато огледът за избор на недвижим имот е вече организиран, положете усилия да бъдете максимално концентрирани върху района. Обърнете внимание на инфраструктурата и не се притеснявайте да задавате въпроси на брокера от избраната агенция за недвижими имоти. Той е Вашият помощник и ще Ви даде информация за всяка селска къща или парцел, посочени в дневния график за избор на недвижим имот. Огледайте и самото село - има ли комуникациите, нужни Ви за живот в селска къща или парцел, на който ще строите по-късно. Дали достъпът е добър за постоянно живеене или не е от голямо значение, тъй като това ще е Вашата лятна вила.<br />Когато оглеждате апартамент за продажба или под наем, обърнете внимание на сградата, в която се намира. Ако е ново строителство, то тя ще отговаря на стандартите и няма да има нужда от допълнителна изолация, например. Ако сте поискали от Вашата агенция за недвижим имот да предложи избор на недвижим имот старо строителство, то обърнете внимание на направените ремонти. При някой градски имоти, поддръжката на общите части е добре организирана, но при други все още не. Поинтересувайте се дали сградата има домоуправител, какъв е редът за почистване и поддръжка на общите части и района около този градски имот - все пак този апартамент за продажба или под наем, ще бъде Вашият нов дом!<br />Когато става въпрос за продажба на български имоти с търговска или индустриална цел и не сте от Велико Търново, опитайте да поговорите по-дълго с брокера от избраната агенция за недвижими имоти. В зависимост от дейността, която ще развивате, при избор на недвижим имот, ще трябва да отчетете подходящ квартал или зона. Всеки градски имот, със своето местоположение, предлага различни условия за развитие на бизнес. Но дори да решите, че това е подходящ квартал или зона, огледайте внимателно видовете продукти и услуги, предлагани в района и отново се консултирайте с Вашия брокер, който от години се занимава с продажба на български имоти, а и основно негово задължение е да Ви помогне да направите точният за вас избор.<br />Не на последно място, бихме искали да Ви посъветваме да се насочвате към имоти, които можете да си позволите. Всеки човек би се възхитил на един добър имот, но при много по-малка налична сума, проявете уважение и не губете времето на продавача с огледи на имот, който не можете да си позволите.

При апартаменти продажба, ако към него има част от дворно място, също се изисква скица. Друг важен документ, който продавачът трябва да предостави е данъчна оценка на имота.<br />Разходи при сделка с имот и кой ги заплаща?<br />Често задаван въпрос е кой поема разходите при имоти продажба или под наем. Когато става въпрос за апартамент под наем, то разходите за комисионна към агенция се дели между двете страни. При покупко-продажба на имоти в България, разходите по сделката се поемат от купувача. В зависимост от района, те са между 3 и 5 % от покупната цена и се заплащат при извършване на покупката.<br />Ако сте избрали да работите с нас, за предварителния договор за покупко-продажба ще се погрижим ние.

Ако сте харесали градски имот или земя, за да сключите предварителен договор, трябва да заплатите 10% от покупната цена, която ще се приспадне от цялата сума, при приключване на сделката.

This is essentially a renewable 2 year visa that enables highly skilled non-EU workers to take up jobs in the EU and to live and work there with their families for up to 2 years before re-applying. Conditions for obtaining a Blue Card are that the applicant has a higher education diploma and at least 5 years experience in the job they are applying for. They will only be employed if there are no Bulgarian workers suitable for the position. Bulgaria currently has a shortfall of skilled workers particularly in the fields of Engineering and IT., and welcomes highly skilled professionals from other countries.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	If you have any queries regarding your personal visa requirements, please consult the Bulgarian Embassy in your current country of residence.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;<br />\r\n	Disclaimer:<br />\r\n	Yantra Homes Ltd. produced this information solely as a service to its clients and in doing so has taken all reasonable care to ensure the accuracy of the content.

Can I get the treatment I need in Bulgaria? How much will it cost?\" etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />Visitors<br />Since 2007 when Bulgaria joined the EU, all EU citizens who are suddenly taken ill or have an accident during a visit to Bulgaria, are entitled to free or reduced-cost treatment, in most cases on production of a valid European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)and provided their stay in the country does not exceed 90 days.<br />&nbsp;<br />To access treatment, you will need your passport and EHIC card. Medicines, however, do have to be paid for. EHIC cards last between 3 and 5 years so please check the expiry date on your card. All members of your family will have to have their own card.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you don\'t qualify for the free or reduced cost health treatment,you must choose between a private international health insurance policy and holiday/travel insurance.<br />&nbsp;<br />Most countries outside of the EU don\'t have reciprocal health agreements, so if you aren\'t covered by Bulgarian social security you must have private health insurance or a holiday/travel policy that covers you in Bulgaria.<br />&nbsp;<br />Residents<br />If you have bought a property in Bulgaria, and are planning to move here permanently, you should ensure that you and your family have full health insurance during the interval between leaving your last country of residence and obtaining health insurance in Bulgaria.<br />One way to insure yourself and your family for this interim period is to take out a holiday/travel insurance policy. If you already have private health insurance, it\'s better to extend your present health insurance policy to provide international cover (which is usually possible) rather than to take out a new policy. This is particularly important if you have an existing health problem that won\'t be covered by a new policy.<br />&nbsp;<br />If you are going to take up residence in Bulgaria and will be working and contributing to Bulgarian social security (called \'NOI\'), you and your family will be entitled to free or subsidised medical and dental treatment from the Bulgarian state system. Once you have a received your Residence Permit you will have to pay contributions through the NOI to the Bulgarian state health system (currently approximately EURO 8 per month). This entitles you to free treatment from a GP, free referrals to a specialist, and medicines at reduced prices or free.<br />&nbsp;<br />It\'s recommended that you take out private health insurance even if you\'re a resident, as the standard of private clinics and hospitals tends to be much higher than that of the state system and are comparatively inexpensive when compared to private clinics elsewhere in Europe. You should also check your entitlements under the Bulgarian state health scheme and when such cover might become effective.<br />&nbsp;<br />Residents who don\'t contribute to social security (e.g. retirees) and aren\'t covered by a reciprocal agreement should take out a private international health insurance policy. International policies offer varying levels of cover, including repatriation in the case of serious illness.<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information and to apply for your EHIC follow this link:&nbsp; https://www.ehic.org.uk<br />&nbsp;<br />Disclaimer:<br />Yantra Homes Ltd.produced this information solely as a service to its clients and in doing so has taken all reasonable care to&nbsp; ensure the accuracy of the content.

Yantra Homes in Veliko Tarnovo will help you to get connected<br />&nbsp;<br />Connecting to Services in Bulgaria<br />&nbsp;<br />Once you have bought your Bulgarian property and decided when you are going to move in, you will want to arrange the connection of essential services such as electricity and water, so how do you get connected?<br />&nbsp;<br />Electricity<br />In the North-Central region of Bulgaria the main provider is E.ON.&nbsp; You will need to apply to E.ON to have your electricity connected and sign a contract specifying the power supply to be installed. If it\'s a new property you will need to prove you\'re the owner by producing a copy of the title deeds or if you are renting in Bulgaria, a copy of the lease. Usually you also need to produce your passport or residence permit.&nbsp; If you plan to pay by direct debit from a bank or post office account, don\'t forget to take along your account details.<br />If you\'re moving into an old property, you must also tell E.ON the name of the person who previously paid the bills (which will be on the title deeds). The bills are then transferred into your name, usually for a nominal fee.&nbsp; Please be aware that unpaid utility bills of the previous owners can often be transferred on to your account. When setting up your account it is wise take along a Bulgarian speaker so that you fully understand what is going on and make sure everything is in order.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Meters<br />In Bulgaria, meters are usually installed in a box on an outside wall of a property. However, if your meter isn\'t accessible from outside and the property isn\'t permanently occupied, make sure you either leave the keys with a neighbour or make arrangements to have your meter read. If your meter cannot be read, you will receive an estimate based on previous bills, although it must be read at least once a year.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bills<br />You\'re normally billed for your electricity each month. Bills can be paid by direct debit, in cash at the post office (Post Bank). By ePay.bg, Transcard payment card or at the E.ON customer services centres in major towns.&nbsp; It\'s also possible to pay a fixed amount each month by standing order based on your estimated usage; at the end of the year you will receive a bill for the amount owing or a rebate of the amount overpaid. These methods of payment are preferable, particularly if it is a holiday home or you\'re a non-resident. If you want to set up a direct debit or standing order at your bank to pay utility bills, you will need to take a copy of the deeds to your house, your limited company registration papers and someone who speaks Bulgarian. <br />&nbsp;<br />Power Cuts<br />In rural Bulgaria the power supply can often weaken or fail totally, sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for several hours, and on occasions, for days.&nbsp; Power cuts are fairly frequent in some areas, especially during thunderstorms, heavy rain and heavy snowfalls.&nbsp; If you live in an area with an unreliable electricity supply it\'s advisable to buy an uninterruptable power supply (UPS) with a battery back-up, which will allow you up to 20 minutes to shut down a computer or other vital equipment when the power shuts off.&nbsp; You may also consider buying a generator for essential electrical items such as a kettle, microwave, television, particularly for cuts during the winter months. You may also consider having a cooker that has both electricity and calor gas as a source of power and keep some candles or oil lamps handy. <br />&nbsp;<br />If the power keeps tripping off when you attempt to use a number of high-powered appliances simultaneously, or the lights dim when you turn on the cooker, it probably means that the rating of your power supply is too low. If this is the case, you need to ask the electricity company to upgrade the power supplied to your property (ie install 3 phase), although your standing charge will be higher for this supply.<br />&nbsp;<br />Electrical Appliances<br />If you are coming to Bulgaria from outside of Europe or the UK, generally it will be much easier to buy new appliances once you have moved into your Bulgarian property and prices are comparable to those elsewhere in Europe.&nbsp; However with smaller items such as toasters, kettles and hair-dryers it is possible to use an adapter or get a qualified electrician to change the plugs. Of course if you are moving from elsewhere in Europe, there should be no problem with voltage or plugs on your household white goods, but you may consider that the age of the items and that the cost of transportation outweighs their value.<br />&nbsp;<br />Mains Gas<br />The gas network in Bulgaria is currently at the fledgling stage, although \'gasification\' is expanding.&nbsp; The north-eastern region of Bulgaria is served by the company Overgas, the largest retailer of natural gas in Bulgaria, and its website (www.overgas.bg ) includes a map of the towns connected to mains gas.<br />When moving into a property already connected to mains gas, you will need to contact the local distribution company to have the gas switched on and/or have the meter read and the account transferred to your name. If you want to be connected to mains gas, the cost depends on the amount of gas you expect to use (e.g. for heating or just for cooking), the average connection charge being around 300 lev (a&sbquo;&not;150).&nbsp; Gas is currently around 40% cheaper than electricity.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bottled Gas<br />Many Bulgarian rural homes have cookers that use bottled gas. Check when moving into a property that the gas bottle isn\'t empty. Keep a spare bottle or two handy and make sure you know how to change the bottles, as this can be quite a complicated procedure.<br />Bottles can be purchased at most petrol stations or delivery can often be arranged through your local mayor. Some houses keep their gas bottles outside, however, if you do this you must buy propane gas rather than butane, as it can withstand a greater range of temperatures, which is for internal use only (in fact, propane gas bottles must be kept outside).<br />&nbsp;<br />Wood<br />Bulgaria relies heavily on wood for heating and hot water, especially during the winter months. Traditionally the heating systems in Bulgarian homes would be by the Jamal (traditional heating system) in each room, however these day most homes have at least one fireplace or stand alone wood burner and many also have back boilers for radiators and hot water.<br />Log deliveries are ordered by the cubic metre and can usually be arranged through your mayor or local woodcutter. Wood will usually be delivered by truck in the form of large uncut logs that will have to be cut down and split into a manageable size to fit in the fireplace. Wood should be well seasoned before it is burnt and the bigger the logs the longer they take to dry out so it is best to have them cut and then stacked and protected from the rain for at least two years before burning so that they season properly. Unseasoned logs generate less heat because they contain a large amount of moisture, they will also cause a build-up of tar and soot in the chimney that can be the cause of chimney fires. When ordering your wood for the first time, order both seasoned (for immediate use) and unseasoned (for the following year(s)).<br />&nbsp;<br />Water<br />Generally the tap water all over Bulgaria is very safe to drink and most properties in Bulgarian towns and villages are connected to mains water.&nbsp; If you buy a new property in Bulgaria, in all likelihood, connection will already be organised by the developer. However, some older Bulgarian rural properties and Bulgarian property developments will need a connection, the cost of which will depend on the type of soil and terrain that must be dug through to lay the pipes.&nbsp; Always check before buying a property without a connection how much it will cost and work this into your budget.<br />&nbsp;<br />Properties that are connected to mains water are metered and charged per cubic metre, there is no standing charge and you will be billed on a monthly basis.&nbsp; When moving into a new property, if not already arranged, you can set up an account at the local municipal offices.&nbsp; Ask the water company to read your meter and transfer the account to your name.<br />Water cuts are rare, but can occur if there is any maintenance work being done on the old leaking pipes and generally you will receive no notice of these cuts, so you could keep a back-up supply to hand, however bottled mineral water is available everywhere and is very inexpensive.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Sewerage &amp; Waste Water<br />Properties in urban areas are usually connected to mains drainage, whereas those in rural areas usually have individual sewage systems.<br />If your property has a septic tank, it should be sited at least 3 metres within the boundaries of your property in a position that will enable it to be emptied easily, although this will only have to be done after 3 to 5 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before buying a property with its own septic tank get it checked out by a professional to ensure it is in good condition and working properly. <br />Before buying a property that needs a septic tank installed or plot for building your own house in Bulgaria, get advice on where the system should be sited and the costs involved.<br />&nbsp;<br />Telecommunications<br />&nbsp;You will notice that all Bulgarians have a mobile phone and seem to talk on them constantly.&nbsp; The three main mobile service providers are&nbsp; Mtel(Vodafone), Globul and Vivacom and between them cover the whole country with the exception of a few mountainous regions.&nbsp; The call rates are very competitive, Pay as you Go, and internet packages are also available. <br />Should you require a fixed line, this is available through BTC (Vivacom), however, most people are happy to solely use their mobile phones.&nbsp; Should you be going backwards and forwards to your home country, it can be useful to get Prepaid SIM cards for both Bulgaria and&nbsp; your home country and swap them over, just remember to send a text every 3-4 months to keep the SIM active, this way friends and family will have numbers for you wherever you are. <br />&nbsp;<br />Internet<br />In 2010, nearly half of the population of Bulgaria had access to the Internet and further developments include Broadband and Wi-Fi, widely available in the region free of charge in cafes and bars.&nbsp; Cable TV/phone/internet packages are available in towns but for more remote areas Satellite digital TV/internet is the best option and can be installed (Bulsatcom) fairly inexpensively depending on the package and internet speed you require.&nbsp; Once the internet has been installed, Skype and VoIP are low cost call options you could consider. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Disclaimer:<br />Yantra Homes Ltd. produced this information solely as a service to its clients and in doing so has taken all reasonable care to ensure the accuracy of the content.

There is much to consider as it is not an easy step to take, and it is true to say that the older the child the more difficult it will be for them to adapt.<br />&nbsp;<br />Moving anywhere abroad with children should be given a lot of consideration, especially where there are not only language barriers, but also cultural differences to be considered.<br />&nbsp;<br />Those with children taking exams, in college or in higher education would be well advised to delay their move to Bulgaria or to find alternative accommodation for their children so they can finish their education.<br />&nbsp;<br />Simply put, the younger the child, the easier it will be to adapt to life in Bulgaria, this is especially true of those who are too young to attend school. Getting vey young ones into Kindergarten as quickly as possible enables them to mix with Bulgarian children, pick up the language and adapt instantly, becoming naturally bi-lingual. Children of an age to attend primary school upwards can find the prospect of attending school a daunting prospect as it can be for parents as they try to obtain the best education they can for their little ones.<br />&nbsp;<br />Pre-school/Kindergarten<br />Education in Bulgaria is not compulsory before the age of seven, but private and state or municipality run pre-schools and kindergartens licensed by the Ministry of Education and Science in Bulgaria are open for children aged 3 to 7.<br />&nbsp;<br />When applying at a pre-school/kindergarten parents must provide:<br />An application form;<br />A copy of the child\'s birth certificate;<br />A medical certificate from the General practitioner about the child\'s vaccinations;<br />Test results for pathogenic intestinal diseases and intestinal parasites (these must be negative) and done 15 days before the child enters the kindergarten;<br />Urine and blood tests of the child, done up to one month before the child goes to the kindergarten;<br />A medical certificate stating that that the child has not been in contact with people suffering from contagious diseases, issued not more than three days before the child starts going to the kindergarten.<br />&nbsp;<br />Kindergarten is optional, however, all children must attend a one-year pre-school programme.<br />&nbsp;<br />Education in Bulgaria<br />Between the ages of 7 and 16 attendance is compulsory and is provided free in state run and municipality schools or for a fee in private establishments.<br />&nbsp;<br />The education system in Bulgaria composes of basic, secondary and higher levels.<br />&nbsp;<br />Basic education is divided into two categories: Elementary (Grades 1 to 4) and Presecondary (Grades 5 to 8). There are 5 school days in a week, and the school year is made up of 2 terms (Sept to Feb &amp; Feb to Jun). Pupils normally attend either a morning or afternoon session, using the other half day for home study.<br />&nbsp;<br />Secondary education has 2 types: Comprehensive (high school) and vocational (technical school).<br />&nbsp;<br />Higher education on the other hand has 3 kinds: Universities, Colleges, and Specialised Higher Education Schools.<br />&nbsp;<br />Your choice of school is:<br />&nbsp;<br />International schools in Bulgaria<br /><br />Fee paying international schools implement the Bulgarian curriculum in the English language but children also have the opportunity to learn the Bulgarian language. Most of these schools are in capital of Bulgaria, Sofia but there are a few elsewhere. Some international schools in Bulgaria cater almost exclusively for the children of diplomats and this is reflected in fees that may be as much as Euro 9000 per year.<br />&nbsp;<br />Private schools in Bulgaria<br /><br />These schools teach the Bulgarian curriculum in Bulgarian but often have a strong specialism, typically in languages or sport. Students usually have to pass written entrance examinations in maths and the Bulgarian language. They can be found in all the major cities and some larger towns. Fees range from Euro 900 to Euro 1800 per annum.<br />&nbsp;<br />State schools in Bulgaria<br /><br />Increased investment in the Bulgarian state education system in Bulgaria has improved standards in recent years. Modern technology and facilities have been introduced across most of the country but there are still some schools in Bulgaria which are in a poor state of repair and have limited facilities. Be sure to inspect the local schools before committing to buying a house in Bulgaria and making the move. All children entering the free state school system need to speak Bulgarian.<br />&nbsp;<br />International Baccalaureate World Schools<br />There are 5 International Baccalaureate Schools in Bulgaria, four in Sofia and one in Veliko Tarnovo offering the IB Diploma Programme catering for students aged 16 to 19 years designed to offer an academically challenging and balanced curriculum with final examinations that prepare students for success at university and working life beyond. The programme is normally taught over two years and has gained recognition and respect from the world\'s leading universities.<br />&nbsp;<br />Education in the Veliko Tarnovo Region<br />Veliko Tarnovo itself is a University town and is home to many good schools and colleges including The American College \'Arcus\' and St Cyril &amp; St Methodius University, the largest state university in Bulgaria outside of Sofia and an internationally acclaimed centre of educational and scientific excellence.<br />&nbsp;<br />For more information on education in the Veliko Tarnovo region, please go to: Veliko Turnovo schools<br />&nbsp;<br />Finally, how well your child adapts to the Bulgarian way of life, to a new language and a new culture can be greatly influenced by you.<br />If you make the effort to learn to speak Bulgarian, are able to communicate with their teachers and help with their homework, they will adjust more easily, quickly make friends and really settle into their new life in Bulgaria.<br />Unless they are attending one of the international schools in Bulgaria, you may have to teach them how to read and write in English at home.<br />&nbsp;<br />Disclaimer:<br />Yantra Homes Ltd. produced this information solely as a service to its clients and in doing so has taken all reasonable care to&nbsp; ensure the accuracy of the content.

In Bulgarian villages it will help you with everyday life<br />&nbsp;<br />The Bulgarian Language and the Cyrillic alphabet (българска азбука)<br />&nbsp;<br />One of the most common questions that the staff at Yantra Homes are asked by people that are thinking of buying a property for the first time in Bulgaria is &ldquo;how do you cope with the Bulgarian language?&rdquo;. People often ask us if they will be able to read anything in Bulgaria because of the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet. At first sight, the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet looks very complicated and different from the Latin, but once you become familiar with it, you will realise that it is not that different and there is nothing to be scared of.<br />&nbsp;<br />Background<br />Bulgarian is a southern Slavic language and about 12 million people speak it, mostly in Bulgaria. Bulgarian is&nbsp; also closely related to Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Serbian and Slovenian. There are many Turkish words in Bulgarian as a result of the long period of occupation by the Ottoman Empire and there are also many words in the language that originate from Latin, Greek and Russian. Nowadays many new words are formed from the English.<br />&nbsp;<br />To help shed some light on the subject, Yantra Homes has written a basic guide to the Bulgarian Cyrilic alphabet and we hope that you will find it useful.<br />Common Letters<br />Some letters from Latin alphabet can be easily associated with Latin letters because the pronunciation is the same or very similar: Bulgarian &lsquo;В&rsquo; sounds like English &lsquo;V&rsquo; as in the word value. &lsquo;С&rsquo; is like &lsquo;S&rsquo; in smoke. Other letters are the same in both alphabets: &lsquo;A&rsquo; is &rsquo;A&rsquo;, &lsquo;O&rsquo; is &lsquo;O&rsquo;, &lsquo;T&rsquo; is &lsquo;Т&rsquo;. The pronunciation is not very different every time, for example &lsquo;T&rsquo; in &lsquo;Turnovo&rsquo; (Veliko Turnovo) sounds like the &lsquo;T&rsquo; in the English word &lsquo;town&rsquo;, &lsquo;A&rsquo; is the same as &lsquo;A&rsquo; in angry, for example.<br />Unique Letters<br />Some of the letters that do not exist in the Latin alphabet can be more difficult to pronounce, but the Bulgarian people know this and are usually very helpful and understanding. The letter &lsquo;Ч&rsquo; is pronounced as &lsquo;ch&rsquo;;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ц&rsquo; is pronounced &lsquo;ts&rsquo;; &lsquo;Ш&rsquo; is &lsquo;sh&rsquo;; &lsquo;Щ&rsquo; is &lsquo;sht&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ж&rsquo; is &lsquo;zh&rsquo; which with a little practice, will become familiar. The easiest way to learn them is to associate them with English words. &lsquo;Ч&rsquo; is like in the beginning of &lsquo;China, chair or chat&rsquo;; &lsquo;Ц&rsquo; is like in beginning of &lsquo;Tsunami or tsar&rsquo;; &lsquo;Ш&rsquo; like in the beginning of &lsquo;she or short&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ж&rsquo; is easily associated to the middle sound in &lsquo;vision or illusion&rsquo;. &lsquo;Щ&rsquo; can be more difficult for some, but sounds very similar to the middle sound of &lsquo;ashtray or fishtail&rsquo;. Other letters unique to Cyrillic are &lsquo;Я&rsquo;, which is &lsquo;ya&rsquo; which sounds like &lsquo;young or yard&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ю&rsquo;, which is &lsquo;yu&rsquo; like in &lsquo;unique or you&rsquo;.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another letter, which does not exist in Latin is &lsquo;Ъ&rsquo; and sounds like the beginning of &lsquo;ugly&rsquo; or the end of &lsquo;letter&rsquo;.&nbsp; A few years ago the standards for translation were not so clear and this letter could have been written like A or U. For example, the road signs said Veliko Turnovo 3 years ago, but now say Veliko Tarnovo. The lack of standards and the fact that the Cyrillic is not so popular in the western world led to different ways of writing and spelling the name of the town: Some foreign people used Veliko Tirnovo, some Veliko Tarnuvo, especially in the very early years of post communist democracy before Latin was accepted as a parallel alphabet, with clear rules for translation.<br />Conclusion<br />Reading maps or road signs in Bulgaria, can be difficult if you haven&rsquo;t practiced the Cyrillic alphabet, however, in the region around Veliko Tarnovo many road signs are now in both Cyrillic and Latin letters; Yantra Homes &lsquo;Veliko Tarnovo&rsquo; would like to introduce you to the Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet and the method of transliteration chosen in 2009 by the Bulgarian authorities that has been the standard since then, remember a little practice will go a long way:<br />&nbsp;<br />Cyrillic alphabet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

На хълма Царевец, защитен от високи стени, се е намирал царският дворец и патриаршията, а на отсрещния хълм Трапезица живеела феодалната аристокрация. Народът живеел в подножието на двата хълма, в Асенова махала, която е запазила името си до днес. Там хората развивали занаятчийство и търговия. Старата столица е била и много оживен културен център, с развита живопис, а също така и Търновската книжовна школа, основавана от патриарх Евтимий. <br />Много легенди за Велико Търново са достигнали до нас и разказват за несметните богатства на града през вековете. Една от тях ни нашепва, че Търновската Библиотека е била зазидана в скалите на&nbsp; Патриаршеския манастир &lsquo;Света троица&rsquo;, заедно с манастирските ценности. Друга история разказва, че крепостта на Трапезица е била царската монетарница, с подземия, в които при нахлуването на турците, били скрити машината за сечене на пари, заедно със суровото злато, сребърните и златни моменти. Входът бил под камък, а тайната знаел само&nbsp; цар Шишман! <br />Не само за тайните подземия под Царевец и Момина Крепост, но и за всички славни битки водили се тук, можем да научим от местния фолклор. Но не само той се предава през годините от поколение на поколение. Занаятите, част, от които могат да се видят и днес на Самоводската Чаршия, също ни отвеждат в онези времена; къщите по улица &bdquo;Гурко&rdquo;, накацали една върху друга и създали онази, Търновската, невероятна панорамна гледка, която привлича хиляди туристи всяка година. <br />И въпреки че е невероятен исторически град, днешното Велико Търново, национална гордост за всеки Българин, запазва стария дух и продължава да расте с бързи темпове, като един от най-модерните градове в страната. Пресечна точка на главни пътни артерии, Велико Търново привлича все повече инвеститори и хора, които запленени от неговата красота, се връщат отново и отново.<br />Не само географското положение и чарът са причините Велико Търново да е предпочитано място в днешни дни. Това е град, който предлага всички удобства вътре в себе си, но в последните години и в околността. Инфраструктурата се подобрява с всяка изминала година, а условията на живот, особено за младите енергични хора &ndash; също. Много инициативи за съживяване на околните села и малки градчета бяха подети от местните хора и управа. Опазването и възстановяването на&nbsp; възрожденската архитектура, прави града дори още по-красив.<br />Велико Търново е от онези градове, които имат какво да предложат на всеки.</p>', 'bg/zavelikotarnovo.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),

The capital of Bulgaria is Sofia which lies to the west of the country close to the Serbian border.<br />Bulgaria totals 110,994 sq km (roughly the size of Iceland) with approximately 7.5 million inhabitants.&nbsp; <br />Bulgaria was divided into 28 regions or &lsquo;oblasts&rsquo; in 1999.&nbsp; Each region bears the name of its devolved capital and is divided again into municipalities.&nbsp; There are 264 municipalities each with their own administrative centre.&nbsp; For example, the Veliko Tarnovo region has 10 municipalities with a total population of 258,494 residents.&nbsp; <br />Bulgaria is a country of exciting diversity with mountain ranges, fertile plains, rivers, lakes and miles of coastline to explore.&nbsp; <br />Sofia &ndash; Capital of Bulgaria<br />Lying at the foot of Vitosha Mountain, Sofia is a bustling city of some 1.7 million people.&nbsp; Founded around 2,500 years ago around its mineral springs, It is today a combination of old orthodox churches, huge communist monoliths and flashy new shops.&nbsp; As a&nbsp; real mixture of old eastern culture and the new western one it is trying to adopt, you will find theatres, museums and galleries right alongside McDonalds, KFC and Starbucks.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Mountain ranges in Bulgaria<br />Sofia itself sits at the foot of Vitosha Mountain (highest peak Cherni Vrah or Black Peak 2290m) which stands proudly over the city.&nbsp; Because of its proximity to Sofia, the mountain has been made easily accessible and therefore is a popular destination for tourists and Bulgarians alike.<br />Other mountain ranges include the Balkan or Stara Planina mountains (highest peak Botev 2,376m) which runs for 560km west to east in north central Bulgaria. It is home to the Central Balkan National Park where there are several important nature reserves where you can find brown bears, wild boar, wolves and deer. Here you will also find the geographical centre of Bulgaria in Uzana, a small resort near the town of Gabrovo, close to the Bulgarka Nature Park. You will also find Veliko Tarnovo, the old capital of Bulgaria nestling in the foothills of the Stara Planina.&nbsp; <br />The highest mountain range is the Rila Mountains situated in southwest Bulgaria (highest peak Musala at 2,925m) occupied in the main by the Rila National Park where there are many large glacial&nbsp;&nbsp; lakes and hot springs. It is also where the popular ski resort of Borovets is located and the magnificent Rila Monastery.<br />&nbsp;The Pirin Mountains, again in the southwest of the country (highest peak Vihren 2,914m), is mainly covered in coniferous forest where many large mammals can be found.&nbsp; It is also where the town of Bansko is situated, famous for its international winter sports activities. <br />&nbsp;The Rhodope Mountains in the southeast (highest peak Golyam Perelik 2,191m) famous for its lakes caves and gorges is home to the Pamporovo ski resort.&nbsp; The beautiful and untamed area has very few inhabitants and contains over 15 reserves with many species of birds of prey.&nbsp; <br />The little known Osogovska Planina in the southwest bordering on Macedonia (highest peak Ruen 2251m), is mainly covered by deciduous forests with crystal clear mountain rivers and streams inhabited by chubb, barbell and trout, literally a fisherman&rsquo;s paradise.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The Bulgarian Plains<br />The Danubian Plain spreads northwards from Veliko Tarnovo and the foothills of the Stara Planina towards the river Danube and Romania.&nbsp; The landscape is characterised by rich rolling hills blessed with rich fertile soil and is highly suitable for the production of grain cereals, rapeseed, sunflowers , vegetables and of course grapes.&nbsp; Prominent towns include Suhindol, Dobrich, Rousse and Lom.&nbsp; Yantra Homes have many properties in this area, please click here for more information.<br />The Thracian Plain lies to the south of the Stara Planina and extends southwards towards the Rhodopes and eastwards where it meets the Black Sea.&nbsp; This low lying area experiences a milder climate than many areas in Bulgaria and is mainly cultivated with fruit, vegetables and grapevines.&nbsp; Prominent towns in the area include Yambol, Plovdiv, Burgas and Sliven.&nbsp; <br />Valley of the Roses<br />North of the Thracian Plain lies the Valley of the Roses, which, as its name implies cultivates roses &ndash; lots of roses, enough in fact to make Bulgaria one of the world&rsquo;s top producers of the highly valued rose oil.&nbsp; The centre of this production is the town of Kazanlak where each year in May they celebrate the Festival of Roses with singing and dance displays.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The Bulgarian Coastline<br />Bulgaria has over 300km of coastline along the Black Sea with 130km of safe sandy beaches making these areas very popular as summer holiday destinations for many Europeans. Major cities on the coast include Varna with the resorts of Golden Sands and St Constantine close by.&nbsp; Burgas, with its stunning old port of Nessebar, is now a major tourist attraction with many bars and restaurants lining the quaint cobbled streets.&nbsp; Popular summer destinations in the area include Sunny Beach and St. Vlas just a few kilometres away.&nbsp; Both Varna and Burgas have their own airports.&nbsp; Further south are the resorts of Sozopol and Kiten which are well known to Bulgarians but little explored by foreign visitors.<br />If you have a home in Bulgaria, you may never want to leave the country for your holidays, but if you love to travel, the neighbouring countries of Greece, Turkey and Romania can all be reached by car, coach or train in a few hours.</p>', 'en/geography.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),

Perhaps you have been intrigued by what seems to outsiders as strange customs and traditions?&nbsp; In discovering Bulgaria&rsquo;s fascinating background you too can get involved and have some fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Pre-historic Bulgaria<br />From Neolithic times the land we currently know as Bulgaria was occupied by primitive tribes then at around 3000BC Thracians arrived and despite invasion from various warring tribes thrived and increased in number.&nbsp; In 29 BC that well known hero Spartacus fought off the Roman invasion but was eventually overcome and Thrace became part of the Roman Empire. <br /><br />First Bulgarian Kingdom<br />&nbsp;When the Roman Empire eventually fell, Thrace came under the authority of Byzantium.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later Slavs and Turkic-Tartar peoples arrived from the Russian plains, the most notable being the Bulgars who, uniting with the Slavic tribes, defeated the Byzantines and formed the first Bulgarian state.&nbsp; During this time Bulgaria flourished and became the Slavic cultural centre.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 886 AD it was decreed by Tsar Boris 1 that Bulgaria should have its own alphabet, the Cyrillic alphabet was born.&nbsp; Named after a Byzantine missionary, St Cyril, who along with his brother St Methodius devised the ancient Glagolitic alphabet, thought to be a derivative of the old Greek alphabet.&nbsp; The Cyrillic alphabet was adopted and adapted by various Eastern European countries including Russia, Macedonia and Serbia.&nbsp; This is known as the First Bulgarian Kingdom.&nbsp; The Byzantines invaded again and once again reduced Bulgaria to an annex. <br />Second Bulgarian Kingdom <br />The Second Bulgarian Kingdom began in 1185 when a revolution led by members of the &lsquo;Boyars&rsquo; or&nbsp;&nbsp; feudal aristocracy, namely Assen &amp; Petar, defeated the Byzantines and power was restored to the Khans who declared Veliko Tarnovo as their capital.&nbsp; In 1393, unable to resist attack, Bulgaria was sacked by the Ottoman Empire, Veliko Tarnovo was destroyed and the country became known as Roumelia, a province of the Turkish Ottoman Empire.&nbsp; <br />Third Bulgarian Kingdom<br />It wasn&rsquo;t until the 18th Century that revolutionaries, tradesmen artists and artisans began what is known as the National Revival and the Third Bulgarian Kingdom, building stylish houses with ornate carvings, typically in the more mountainous regions, as can be seen in the architectural reserve village of Bojentsi and right next door to our own Yantra Homes office where you will find the &lsquo;House with the Monkey&rsquo; built by Revivalist architect and craftsman Kolio Ficheto who also built the town hall in VT and the covered bridge in Lovech.<br /><br />In 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire and liberated Bulgaria.&nbsp; For many years after the liberation of the Balkan states, bitter conflict ensued between the various countries with territories changing hands and new borders being formed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Communism <br />&nbsp;After World War II Bulgaria became part of the Eastern Block until the end of Communism in 1989.&nbsp; During communist times all agricultural land was seized from its owners and turned into State farms and cooperatives run by the government.&nbsp; After the fall of communism, there were demands for the return of land and property.&nbsp; In 1992 Bulgaria passed Restitution Laws and returned the land to their former owners.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Present Day<br />It is interesting to note that Bulgaria still has a Royal Family.&nbsp; Simeon Borisov of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, born Tsar Simeon II in 1937 reigned for a short period from 1943 to 1946 before going into exile until the communist era came to an end.&nbsp; He returned in 2001 and took up office as Prime Minister until 2005 and instigated Bulgaria&rsquo;s joining of the EU.&nbsp; He is related to Queen Elizabeth II and other European royalty.&nbsp; <br />The current President of Bulgaria is Rosen Plevneliev, who was elected in January 2012. The Prime Minister is Boyko Borisov (GERB Party).&nbsp; Bulgaria is a member of the United Nations, also a member of OSCE (1992), BSEC (1992), WTO (1996), NATO (2004), and EU (2007).<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying a house in Bulgaria, the country has a vast number of places of interest for you to visit, so many customs and traditions, feast days and festivals for you to enjoy and Bulgarians are happy for you to join the fun.</p>', 'en/history.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),

Bulgarian Easter eggs are primarily red in colour.&nbsp; Red Easter eggs decorated with religious symbols may be cracked against each other to see who will have the most luck during the following year.&nbsp; <br />Christmas<br />If you have bought a property in Bulgaria and are at home during Christmas festivities, on Christmas Eve you may have the pleasure of entertaining the Koledari. Koledari are Christmas carolers who traditionally visit the houses of their relatives, neighbours and other villagers after midnight and perform.&nbsp; The carolers are usually young men from the village dressed in traditional attire and brandishing long sticks of called Survachka decorated with popcorn, coloured threads, dried fruits and coins.&nbsp; During their songs they gently beat their audience with the stick wishing them health, wealth and happiness and are usually rewarded with food.&nbsp; <br />Name Days <br />Since early Christian times Bulgarians have celebrated their name days. Most Bulgarians are named after a saint so when the corresponding Saint Day arrives they celebrate with family and friends.<br />St Nicholas Day<br />The winter feast of St Nicholas is celebrated by Bulgarians on 6th December when traditionally a large carp and bread are eaten.&nbsp;&nbsp; St Nicholas is considered the patron saint of seamen and children and the feast is celebrated throughout Europe in various ways.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;St George&rsquo;s Day<br />Perhaps the most celebrated of the name days is that of the patron saint of shepherds St. George which takes place on 6th May when traditionally a whole lamb is cooked and enjoyed by family and friends.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you thinking about buying a house in Bulgaria, the country has a vast number of places of interest for you to visit, so many customs and traditions, feast days and festivals for you to enjoy and Bulgarians are happy for you to join the fun.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>', 'en/culture.tpl', 'template', 'DB'),
