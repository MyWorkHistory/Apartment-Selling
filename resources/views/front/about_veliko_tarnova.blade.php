              <p>Veliko Tarnovo GeographyVeliko Tarnovo is close to the Geographic centre of Bulgaria. It is connected East and West by a major highway that terminates at the capital city of Sofia and Varna on the Black Sea Coast. The North/South highway is one of the most important in the Balkans as it connects the continents of Asia with Europe. There is a regional airport at Gorna Oryahovitsa and the international airports are almost equidistant at Sofia, Varna, Burgas, Plovdiv and across the Romanian border in Bucharest. The town of Veliko Tarnovo itself is unusual in that it clings to a high hill that overlooks the Yantra River. There is a modern town centre containing all the facilities of any town in Bulgaria, but it is the rich historical area that attracts thousands of visitors each year from all over the world.</p>
