              <p><strong>Are you considering buying property in Bulgaria?</strong>
              <br>
              This guide offers information to assist you in making informed decisions when investing in Bulgarian real estate. Please note that individual circumstances may affect the buying process, so it is best to seek advice from a real estate professional.</p>

              <p><strong>Land Ownership in Bulgaria</strong><br>
              Foreigners face some restrictions on owning Bulgarian land, according to the Bulgarian Act on Foreign Investment. EU citizens can own land for commercial or residential use, while non-EU citizens must register a Bulgarian Limited Company to own property with such land. The registration process is straightforward and takes around five working days, and can be done in person or by granting power of attorney to a solicitor or other trusted party such as Yantra Homes.</p>    
            </div>


            <div>
           <p><strong> Forming a Limited Company in Bulgaria</strong> <br> Two types of companies are available: Limited Liability Companies, formed by two or more shareholders, and Sole Proprietor Limited Companies, which are owned by a single individual. The minimum required capital for the company is two levs. You are required to open a collective bank account and deposit the capital in it as a part of the company setup process. All necessary registration documents will be arranged by a solicitor. Once the company is set up, you can close the collective account and you can open a business bank account to make payments for property. It is also possible to open a personal bank account for transferring funds for property purchases.</p>

            <p><strong>The Preliminary Contract for Buying Property in Bulgaria</strong></p>

              <p>When a suitable property is found, a Bulgarian Real Estate Agent would prepare a preliminary contract which protects the interests of both the buyer and seller. A 10% non-refundable deposit is required from the buyer. For completion in front of a notary, the seller must provide original ownership documents, an updated property plan, a tax assessment and other documents such as inheritance certificates or documents from the Property Register with no outstanding debts or court disputes.</p>

              <p>To finalise the purchase, the buyer must provide minutes of the General meeting of the company containing a resolution to purchase real estate in Bulgaria. Payments for properties over 10,000 levs must be made through a bank, and taxes and notary fees must also be paid.<br><br>
              Owning a Bulgarian Limited Company legally requires an annual return, but if the company is not actively trading, this is a straightforward process. The purchase process usually takes four weeks, and the buyer must pay the remaining 90% of the property price, as well as taxes and notary fees, to obtain the title deeds for the property.</p>

              • Notary, stamp, court fees and property tax (legal fees) are approx 4 – 5% of the declared deed value (see Property Tax section above). (This fee is paid directly to the Notary Public);<br>

            <p><strong>Warning when Buying Properties in Bulgaria</strong><br>
            Pease note: In the past, it was common in Bulgaria for property sellers and buyers to declare a lower value than the actual price of the property on the title deed in order to save on property taxes. However, this is an illegal practice. Even though this might seem like a good idea at the time of purchase, it can end up causing problems for the buyer in the future, especially when it comes to selling the property and having to pay more in capital gains tax. So, it's important to declare the real price of the property on the title deed.</p>
