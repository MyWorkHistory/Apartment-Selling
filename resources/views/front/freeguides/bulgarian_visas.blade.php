          <p><strong>Bulgarian Visa Requirements</strong><br> If you are coming to Bulgaria, either on a viewing trip, a holiday or moving here permanently, will you need a Visa? What are the rules surrounding visa requirements and what do you need in the way of documents to obtain various Residency Permits?</p>
          </div>   


            <div>
            <p>If you are an EU citizen travelling to Bulgaria you will be pleased to know that there are no visa requirements for short visits up to 90 days.<br>
Should you wish to stay longer or are planning to live in Bulgaria permanently, a Long Term Residency Permit can easily be obtained from your local Immigration Department, however, unless you speak Bulgarian, it would be wise to take along a Bulgarian speaker to translate and to help you complete the application form.</p>

Bulgaria was the first country to implement the new Blue Card from 1st June 2011. This is essentially a renewable 2 year visa that enables highly skilled non-EU workers to take up jobs in the EU and to live and work there with their families for up to 2 years before re-applying. Conditions for obtaining a Blue Card are that the applicant has a higher education diploma and at least 5 years experience in the job they are applying for. They will only be employed if there are no Bulgarian workers suitable for the position. Bulgaria currently has a shortfall of skilled workers particularly in the fields of Engineering and IT., and welcomes highly skilled professionals from other countries.</p>
