          <p><strong>Let’s Get Going...</strong><br> Just the thought of moving house, let alone moving to another country, can fill people with apprehension and experts believe that it is the most expensive and life-changing event most people ever undertake, it’s also one of the most stressful, being both physically and mentally exhausting. But,with a bit of careful planning and preparation it is possible to reduce the strain and get your new life in Bulgaria off to a good start!</p>

            <p><strong>Exporting your home contents to your new Bulgarian Property</strong><br>Getting your household effects to your new property in Bulgaria can be expensive, depending on how you mean to transport them and what you choose to bring with you. So decide what you absolutely must keep and what you really can give to charity, sell at a car boot sale, sell on eBay or throw in the bin because it could be cheaper to buy new items once you have arrived and set up you house in Bulgaria and will save a lot on transportation costs.</p>

            <div>
            <p><strong>Plan Ahead </strong> <br> Shipping by road takes approximately three to four days and by sea container a lot longer, so plan ahead regarding hotel reservations or alternative accommodation such as rental property, until your possessions arrive and you have all your services connected.</p>

            <p><strong> Removals Companies </strong> <br> Depending on your purse strings, and if appropriate, get quotes from at least three reputable removals companies who will also ‘export pack’ your belongings or who can recommend a professional packing company to do this for you. Of course, it is extra expense but well worth it as correct packing prevents undue damage to your precious items and they stand a better chance of arriving in one piece! If you decide on taking everything bar the kitchen sink you could have a self-fill container, a trailer or a designated vehicle with a crew to help you unload once you have reached your new home in Bulgaria. Many people forget that unloading can be a gruelling task especially in the Bulgarian summer months where temperatures are around 30?C or in the winter where they can be as low as -15?C. So decide whether help is needed and make sure your movers are aware of this as there may be additional costs involved.</p>

           <div>
            <p>Remember, if you do decide to use a professional removal company and you have any parking restrictions at your present property, you will need to contact the local authorities to arrange for a suspension of the restrictions outside your property on and around moving day as it can take more than one day to load the lorry. A removal lorry can be the same size as a double decker bus and needs extra space for manoeuvring into position and the rear of the vehicle should be directly outside your front door. You should provide the movers with a copy of the inventory, your mobile phone number and instructions on how to find the address of your new home in Bulgaria so that on the pre-arranged arrival date, you can meet them at your property.</p>

           <p>You can of course do your own packing and depending on the size of your move you could opt for a part load, (sharing a vehicle with other small consignments), which is the most economical way of transporting your goods, or if you have managed to lose most of your chattels and are taking very little with you, you may decide to save the expense and drive yourself and your possessions across Europe, particularly if you don’t want to part with your car.<br> </p>

            <p>f you do decide to drive over, you will also have to take an inventory of what you have with you, and carry this with you to present to customs. You will also be asked for proof of ownership of your vehicle and should therefore carry your registration documents (ensuring YOUR name is on them), and a valid driving licence. If you are driving with a trailer make sure your goods are secure and are safe during overnight stops. It is not advisable to drive during the winter months as some roads can be perilous due to snow and icy conditions.</p>
